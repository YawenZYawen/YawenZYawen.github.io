<h2>RESEARCH EXPERIENCE</h2>

<p>
  <b>Research Assistant</b> | Elizabethtown College | Elizabethtown, PA |  08/2020 – present<br>
  Project: <b>Game Theory - Equilibrium Problem in Multiple-Strategy Game</b><br>
  <i>Supervisor: Dr. Timothy McDevitt, Professor of Mathematical Sciences at Elizabethtown College</i>
  <li>
    Proved that Nash equilibrium makes the conservative players, who accept ties , in two strategyies games,s more likely to win, compared to the aggressive players who think winning is everything, and illustrated that the phenomenon is transferable and robust in three strategies non-zero-sum strategy games
  </li>
  <li>
    Calculated the probability of conservative players winning over aggressive players in two strategy games, and used matrix derivatives and linear programming to analyze multiple-strategy games and empirically demonstrated that
the probability goes down as the number of strategies increases
  </li>
  <li>
    Used Mathematica to write an algorithm, based on Markov chain, to simplify the probability metrices in Penney' game, and generalized this application numerally and symbolically, and found it align with the phenomenon
  </li>
  </li>
